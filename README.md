# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 18 May 2025

Thank you for using Guest Wifi. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.

⸻

**1. Information We Do Not Collect**

Guest Wifi is designed to function without collecting any personal information from users.

We do not collect, store, share, or transmit:
	•	Personal data (such as name, email address, or location)
	•	Usage or analytics data
	•	Device identifiers
	•	Wi-Fi credentials entered by users

All network credentials you input remain on your device only. They are never sent to any external server or third party.

⸻

**2. QR Code and Sharing Functionality**

Guest Wifi generates QR codes and allows sharing of Wi-Fi credentials locally on your device. When you share credentials via messaging apps, you do so using your own communication channels. Guest Wifi does not track or store these actions.

⸻

**3. Data Security**

Since we do not collect any data, there is no risk of your data being exposed through our systems. All data you enter into the app stays on your device and is not accessible by us.

⸻

**4. Third-Party Services**

Guest Wifi does not use third-party services such as analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or cloud-based storage providers.

If you choose to share network credentials through third-party apps (e.g., Messages, WhatsApp), their respective privacy policies will apply.

⸻

**5. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy if required, for example, due to changes in regulations or features. We encourage you to check this page periodically.

Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective Date” at the top of this policy.
